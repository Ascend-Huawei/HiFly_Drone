## Pull Request
Before we can accept a pull request (PR) from you, you will need to sign a **[Contributor License Agreement (CLA)](https://clasign.osinfra.cn/sign/Z2l0ZWUlMkZhc2NlbmQ=)**. This step takes no more than a minute and you only need to do it once. 

Be sure to follow our [Coding Guidelines](#programming-specifications) and keep code changes as small as possible
to enable us to swiftly review and accept your pull request. Please create one pull request per issue and provide the link to the issue in the pull request. You may refer to other [PR recommendations](#recommendations-for-pr-submission) below.

Submitting a pull request is simple, below we list the steps to submit a PR in 3 easy steps. 
### 1. Fork the original repo
You should fork the original repo and create personal working branches for different features/issues to keep the main repo clean and your personal workflow isolated.

### 2. Code modification
Make changes in the file to integrate your changes. Once you are done, stage, commit, and push the changes you have made to your forked repo:
```
git add .
git commit -m "commit message here"
git push -u origin
```

### 3. Preview changes and submit PR
Navigate to the original repo and submit a pull request by clicking "New Pull Request" or click on "Compare and pull request" if you are in your forked repo. Include a detail description regarding the changes you have made and then click on the "Sumbit pull request". All done, your PR is now submitted to HiFly_Drone for review and approval!

This [video](https://youtu.be/j6yU5hGP4ko) shows the process.

### Recommendations for PR Submission

To integrate your contribution as seamlessly as possible, we advise doing the follow:
- ‚úÖ Verify your PR is **up-to-date with origin/main.** If your PR is behind origin/main, an automatic GitHub actions may be attempted by including the `/rebase` command in the comments. Alternatively, you may run the following code to fetch up-to-date contents from upstream, merge your changes, and push to your forked repo. (Replace '<local_branch>' with the name of your local branch):
```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/Ascend-Huawei/HiFly_Drone.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout <local_branch>
git merge upstream/main
git push -u origin
```
- ‚úÖ Verify all Continuous Integration (CI) checks are passing.
- ‚úÖ Make the **absolute minimal changes** required for your PR and avoid purely formatting changes when no code is modified.
